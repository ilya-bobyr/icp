//! Command are objects produced from the user input.
//!
//! This module contains command parsing mechanism that is responsible for
//! parsing commands, showing usage information and providing completion
//! suggestions, making it easier for the user to discover and use commands.
//!
//! There is also a predefined [`help`] command, and a [`table`] of commands,
//! that holds all the commands available to the user.
//!
//! Currently, commands are distinguished by the first word the user enters.
//! Completion and suggestions work differently when entering the first word
//! into the command prompt vs entering arguments for a specific command.
//!
//! While entering the first word, it is compared against the `keyword()` values
//! of all the registered commands.  At the moment, the full command name need
//! to be type, but suggestions will show all the possibilities and completion
//! can be used to speed things up a bit.  It would make sense to accept a
//! non-ambiguous prefix in place of a full command keyword.
//!
//! When the user types the first white space a specific command is selected.
//! At this point completion is based on the selected command and the
//! suggestions show possible values for this particular command.
